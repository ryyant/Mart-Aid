**Motivation**

We often say that we **don&#39;t have enough time** , to meet friends, to run errands, and to plan. This highlights the importance of convenience in our lives. We always choose the easy way out, the road is more convenient. And so, amidst the hustle and bustle of living life, wouldn&#39;t one want to be able to have an overview of their expenses or agendas?

As the saying goes **&quot;If you fail to plan, you plan to fail**&quot;, this is the crux of why we should plan ahead, see the big picture and fuel ourselves to work towards our goals. If only there was an **easy way out** to manage our expenses and daily agendas, then wouldn&#39;t everyone be able to have a more organised life?

**Aim**

**Features and Timeline**

A **mobile application** allows users to sign up manually and enjoy simple game features. The application will send uplifting messages at customisable intervals to the users to motivate them as well.

An **expenses tracker** , an extension to the mobile application, allows users to log in their expenses and type of expenditure, while providing basic analysis on their expenditures and their budget. Expenditures logged in can be saved in order to allow for simple future re-entry.

A **to-do list** , an extension to the mobile application, allows users to set agendas for the day or any other customisable time period. Additionally, this list will allow users to set when they want to be reminded about certain tasks, and remind them accordingly.
